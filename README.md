I’m a creative technologist with a strong product sense. Currently, my interests lie in designing augmented forms of information in digital content, education, and the travel space. I constantly spark ideas from identifying needs, and engineer systems of intersecting technology to answer. 
My recent projects are towards applications of Generative AI, Human-like Agents, and Computer Vision.

🏆 I’ve won 23/32 hackathons. 17 wins were with complete strangers. 3 solo wins. Including wins at Stanford x2, Yale, and MIT x4. More importantly, 32 hackathons of learning - I've written 25k words of reflections, feedback from teammates and my derived learnings.

Some of my ideas are good, unfeasible at current behavioural or technology states, or just weird. I'm always exploring the one I have greatest empathy for - with sound economic and user justification.
👋 Always open to chat and see if we have a skill fit!

🔭 Products on my horizon:
- A school report generator app for my Mum.
- Stealth 1, simplifies a process that everyone in Australia must do.
- Stealth 2, augments digital content interpretation.

🌱 I never want to work on a product which has a business model that relies on getting our users addicted.

⚡ Fun facts:
- I've failed thrice to get into my university’s dance crew.
- I did a 3 month long hackathon to win a trip to S.Korea, partially motivated by the fact my favourite dance studio classes are there.
- I kinda wish my workplace's Enterprise GitHub contributions count in my personal GitHub – my green squares are lost!
